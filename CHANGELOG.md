# Changelog

All notable changes to hub-core will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **DEPRECATION**: `Plexus` type renamed to `DynamicHub` to clarify architecture
  - `Plexus` remains as a deprecated type alias for backwards compatibility
  - Will be removed in a future major version
  - Rationale: "Plexus" implied special infrastructure, when it's actually just an `Activation` with dynamic registration
  - See architecture documentation for migration guide

### Migration Guide

Replace `Plexus` with `DynamicHub` in your code:

```rust
// Before
use hub_core::plexus::Plexus;
let hub = Plexus::new().register(activation);

// After
use hub_core::plexus::DynamicHub;
let hub = DynamicHub::new().register(activation);
```

The `Plexus` type alias will continue to work but will show deprecation warnings.
